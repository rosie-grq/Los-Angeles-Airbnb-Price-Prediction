# Los-Angeles-Airbnb-Price-Prediction

## Goal

The aim of the project is to understand the factors that affect the price of Airbnb listings in Los Angeles- one of the top tourist cities, predict the price of listings and investigate the effect of overpriced and underpriced property on its future availability. The model not only provides insight to customers so that they have the resources to plan their travel lodging in advance and make better informed decisions, but also guides hosts to set the price that increases the booking rate.

5. Further Work

## Conclusions

1. Using the log of 3-day total price (3*daily rate+cleaning fee) as the dependent variable combined with gradient boosting algorithm results in the highest test set R-squared value of 0.836. 
2. The most important features vary across different models, but bedroom, bathroom, longitude, latitude, host-id and reviews per month are consistently ranked high in feature importance. 
3. The host could gain an advantage by setting the price slightly lower than comparable listings to get more booking.
